KaKs Parser
A web-based tool for parsing and analyzing Ka/Ks data from files generated by the TBtools KaKs Calculator. This application processes evolutionary biology data from .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .tsv, or .csv files produced by TBtools KaKs Calculator, calculates metrics like average Ka, Ks, and Ka/Ks ratios, and provides filtering and export functionalities.
Features

File Upload: Supports drag-and-drop or file selection for multiple files.
Data Parsing: Extracts Ka, Ks, and optional Effective Length from tab-separated files generated by TBtools KaKs Calculator.
Metrics: Calculates averages, max/min Ka/Ks, median Ka/Ks, and counts of Ka/Ks > 1.
Filtering: Filter by gene name, Ka/Ks > 1, or minimum effective length.
Export: Export consolidated results or detailed data per file as CSV.
Visualization: Displays results in tables with color-coded Ka/Ks values (purifying, neutral, positive selection).
Error Handling: Reports errors for invalid files or data rows.

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/kaks-parser.git


Navigate to the project directory:cd kaks-parser


Open index.html in a web browser. No server setup is required as the application runs client-side.

Alternatively, host the files on a web server (e.g., using GitHub Pages or a local server like http-server).
Usage

Open the application in a web browser.
Drag and drop files or click "Browse Files" to select .xls, .xlsx, .txt, .tsv, or .csv files generated by TBtools KaKs Calculator.
View consolidated results and detailed data tables.
Use filters to narrow down results:
Search by gene name.
Show only entries with Ka/Ks > 1.
Set a minimum effective length.


Export results as CSV using the provided buttons.

File Format Requirements

Files must be tab-separated (for .txt, .tsv, .csv) or Excel format (.xls, .xlsx) as output by TBtools KaKs Calculator.
Required columns (case-insensitive):
Seq_1 or Sequence_1: First sequence/gene name.
Seq_2 or Sequence_2: Second sequence/gene name.
Ka: Non-synonymous substitution rate.
Ks: Synonymous substitution rate.


Optional column: Effective_Len (rows with value < 100 are skipped).
Rows with missing, non-numeric, or NA values for Ka or Ks are skipped.

Example File (tab-separated, as generated by TBtools KaKs Calculator):
Seq_1	Seq_2	Ka	Ks	Effective_Len
GeneA	GeneB	0.1	0.2	150
GeneC	GeneD	0.15	0.1	200

Please include tests and update documentation as needed, ensuring compatibility with TBtools KaKs Calculator output.
Limitations

Only parses files generated by TBtools KaKs Calculator; other Ka/Ks data formats may not be compatible.
Binary Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) require a library like SheetJS for proper parsing (not yet implemented).
Large files may impact performance due to client-side processing.
CSV exports may not handle special characters (e.g., commas in gene names) correctly.

Planned Improvements

Add support for .xls/.xlsx parsing using SheetJS.
Implement dynamic delimiter detection for CSV/TSV files.
Add pagination for large datasets.
Include visualizations (e.g., Ka/Ks histograms) using Chart.js.
